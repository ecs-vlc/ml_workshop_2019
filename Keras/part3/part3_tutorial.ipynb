        "In this final practical session we'll use Keras to model and analyse sequence data using recurrent neural networks made from computational blocks called a \"Long Short Term Memory\", or LSTM. In the first part of the tutorial we'll explore how we can predict language - given a starting character, can we predict what will come next? We'll start by implementing a simple \"1st-order Markov Chain\" to learn the transisition probabilities between characters, and we'll then compare this to a model that can learn longer-term dependencies using a recurrent neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second part will look at sequence classification. Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence. What makes this problem difficult is that the sequences can vary in length, be comprised of a very large vocabulary of input symbols and may require the model to learn the long-term context or dependencies between symbols in the input sequence. We've already explored how we can overcome this problem using Bag of Word approaches, but we've also seen that BoWs have limitations because they ignore word order. N-grams were suggested as an alternative, but they have their own problems with feature explosion. In this exercise, you will discover how you can overcome these problems by developing LSTM recurrent neural network models for sequence classification problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "* How to learn a language model using a recurrent network & to sample the model to generate new language.\n",
        "* How to use callbacks during training to monitor progress.\n",

        "## Acknowledgements\n",
        "The LSTM-based Nietzsche generator described in the first part of the tutorial comes from the Keras examples. The second part of this tutorial is largely based on the first section of Jason Brownlee's [\"Sequence Classification with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras\"](https://machinelearningmastery.com/sequence-classification-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) tutorial. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "To use this tutorial you'll use the Python 3 language with the `keras` deep learning library and the `tensorflow` backend. We'll also use the `scikit-learn` and `numpy` packages. For this lab we'll use a Jupyter notebook running in the cloud on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). Colab gives us free access to a virtual machine with GPU acceleration and all the prerequisite libraries pre-installed."

The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment. The data was collected by Stanford researchers and was used in a 2011 paper where a split of 50-50 of the data was used for training and test. An accuracy of 88.89% was achieved.\n",

Unlike one-hot encoding of words, a word embedding has a much lower dimensionality, and is designed to be able to capture synonomy. Word embedding is a technique where words are encoded as real-valued vectors in a high dimensional space, where the similarity between words in terms of meaning translates to closeness in the vector space. \n",

We will also limit the total number of words that we are interested in modeling to the 5000 most frequent words, and zero out the rest. Finally, the sequence length (number of words) in each review varies, so we will constrain each review to be 500 words, truncating long reviews and pad the shorter reviews with zero values.\n",
