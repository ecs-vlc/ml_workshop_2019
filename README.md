# Interdisciplinary Workshop on AI 2019

Welcome to the repository for our workshop, part of the festival for doctoral research 2019. The notebooks are grouped into folders according to the skills / tools that they cover. Specifcally these are: Python, scikit-learn and Keras. While it is possible to run the notebooks on your own machine, we recommend opening them in a Colab environment.

## Opening in Colab

Colab is a free resource provided by Google that can be used to run Jupyter notebooks. It provides a useful platform to develop and test data science code, even if it requires the use of a GPU. The notebooks in this repo can be opened in Colab with the following instructions:

1. Go to the Colab website: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Choose Github in the top bar
3. Type `ecs-vlc` into the search box and hit enter
4. Ensure that this repository is selected from the drop down
5. Get coding!
