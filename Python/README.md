# LearnPython

For a Python tutorial, we are linking to the notebook repository from resident vlc-er, Greg Parkes: https://github.com/gregparkes/PythonCourse

## Opening in Colab

Follow the previous instructions but instead of typing in `ecs-vlc`, use `gregparkes` to open the LearnPython notebooks in Github, there's even a bit of machine learning in the later sections!
