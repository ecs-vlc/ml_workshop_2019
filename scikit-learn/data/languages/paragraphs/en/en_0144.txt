Wikipedia has seen been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification",[358] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.[359] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.[360]
