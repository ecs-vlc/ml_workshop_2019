According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-like.[86] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability",[87] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[88] It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[89] This can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid.[90] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[91] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.[92] This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).
