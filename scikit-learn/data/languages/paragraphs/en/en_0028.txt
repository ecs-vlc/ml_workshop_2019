Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as edit warring.[102][103] Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[notes 8] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a request for comment.
