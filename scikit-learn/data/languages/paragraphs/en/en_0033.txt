Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[111] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.[112] Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a communityÂ ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization".[113] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, 1 percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits."[114] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[115]
