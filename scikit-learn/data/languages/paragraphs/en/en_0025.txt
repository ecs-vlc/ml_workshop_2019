Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[93][94] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority.[95] Wikipedia's contributors avoid a tragedy of the commons by internalizing benefits. They do this by experiencing flow and identifying with and gaining status in the Wikipedia community.[96]
