Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open.

The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[367][368]
