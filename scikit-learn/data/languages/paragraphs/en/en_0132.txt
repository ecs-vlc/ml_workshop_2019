Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree onâ€”the reality we just agreed on".[178] Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[337] as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today".[338]
