Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[310][311][312] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[313] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[314] – though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[315] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[316] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[317]
