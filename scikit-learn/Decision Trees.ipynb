    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, learn Decision Tree Classification, attribute selection measures, and how to build and optimize a Decision Tree Classifier using Python Scikit-learn package. Based on the following article: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/decision-tree-classification-python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in a recursive manner, imaginatively called recursive partitioning. The learned tree can be visualised as a flowchart and is hopefully easy to interpret...\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind any decision tree algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Place the best attribute, selected according to an Attribute Selection Measure (ASM), of the dataset at the root of the tree.\n",
    "2. Split the training set into subsets. Subsets should be made in such a way that each subset contains data with the same value for an attribute.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 on each subset until you find leaf nodes in all the branches of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various ASMs can be used, such as: Information gain, gain ratio and Gini, these may give subtly different results so it's worth having a go with a few of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, as with all machine learning, let's start by loading in some data. We'll use the Pima Indian Diabetes (public domain) data, obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\n",

That's why we always have a test set, it helps ensure we're not just overfitting.
