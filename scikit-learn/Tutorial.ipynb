    "What happened here? As we have seen, with the original dataset the separation between `alt.atheism` and `soc.religion.christian` was not very clear and having an overwhelming number of examples from one of the classes made the two groups even less distinguishable. Yet, the accuracy has increased. For this reason, we must be very careful when choosing a metric, as it can be misleading. In the case of unbalanced datasets, the AUROC (Area under reciever operator characteristic) and AUPR (Area under precision recall) curves are more indicative of how well we perform on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about having to diagnose whether patients have a rare disease or not. Naturally, we would have more data about healthy patients. If we do not choose our measure of performance carefully, our machine might end up labelling all patients as healthy, as it is more probable that a person does not suffer of a rare disease. In the case of newsgroup classification, the fact that the classifier cannot distinguish the two categories doesn't seem that much of a problem. However a medical classifier not being able to identify ill patients would be more problematic.\n",
    " \n",
    "This article (https://towardsdatascience.com/handling-imbalanced-datasets-in-machine-learning-7a0e84220f28) extensively explains the problem both intuitively and from a statistical point of view and point out some limitations of the popular work-around methods. The same article discusses confusion matrices, precision, recall and F1.\n"
